# BANKSapi
The repository is for the BANKSapi Project.  

You can download the notebooks and model weights from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TNdNkg4LLA8ZXgh5ooUMICpC7uO3GbMe/view)

This repository includes two Jupyter Notebooks and the link to download the model weights that can be reloaded.
These two Notebooks can be played by using **Google Colaboratory**. But some of dependencies must be installed. Generally, the (!pip install) should work. For your consideration, I build a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cican/banksapi-project/) to run these two Notebooks. 

You can run these two notebook by clicking the following links:  
[Regression problem](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GtBXk1GLmq7jB9-I-klbDpYTm333-XQ-)  
[Classification problem](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I1vDBGbKYLZaAEqJkM1DUKOPYR-vpw1_)

Here you can also find the **Dockerfile** and **requirements** file for the docker building.
