# BANKSapi
The repository is for the BANKSapi Project.  

This repository includes two Jupyter Notebooks and the model weights that can be reload.
These two Notebooks can be played by using **Google Colaboratory**. But some of dependencies must be installed. Generally, the (!pip install) should work. For your consideration, I build a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cican) to run these two Notebooks. 

Here you can also find the **Dockerfile** and **requirements** file for the docker building.
