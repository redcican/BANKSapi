# BANKSapi
The repository is for the BANKSapi Project.  

This repository includes two Jupyter Notebooks and the link to download the model weights that can be reloaded.
These two Notebooks can be played by using **Google Colaboratory**. But some of dependencies must be installed. Generally, the (!pip install) should work. For your consideration, I build a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cican/banksapi-project/) to run these two Notebooks. 

Here you can also find the **Dockerfile** and **requirements** file for the docker building.
